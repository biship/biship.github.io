             Recent news: We are going home to NZ in 8 days (check counter left).
             4 weeks of sun and beer and bikinis. Got a sway bar for my car,
             junk for stew and crap for kerry. even stuff for dave. oh and rubbish
             for mum+anne. Hurd everyone back home is fit as a fiddle so i have
             put down my pizza and have given up drinking till i get home (god
             help me). Kerry is taunting me to climb, surf, buggy and probably
             do other sports in which he proves to me once again he is fitter
             and insainer than me. We are looking forward to lion red, pies,
             bacon and carrots with that yummy sauce. </font></p>

        We are now in <a href="http://www.auroraoh.com/">Aurora, OH</a>. It is
        located about 30 mins East of Cleveland. I am working at <a href="http://www.mbt.com/">Masterbuilders</a> in
        Beachwood OH, which is basically a suburb of Cleveland. Work is only
        20 mins away. A little faster when driving the BEAST. :) We have found
        an apartment complex called <a href="http://www.rent.net/cgi-bin/chome/RentNet/scripts/APT/aptDetails.jsp?direct=residenceatbarrington">The
        Barrington Apartments</a>. We have a really nice 2 lvl, 2 bedroom adjoined
        apartment. The cat loves the stairs. My project goes live on June 1st,
        and I stick around until June 8th. Work has not yet said where I am going,
        but a few places have been mentioned. <br>
                          <br>
        The car has some 4000 miles on it, time for new brakes and tires.. hehehehe.
        Got well over 400 DVD's now.. and got Sooo many to watch.. someone needs
        to come here and help! </font></p>

                <p>Yippee! It is well into y2k and we are still alive. In fact 
                  we even survived 9 days of binge drinking in the UK courtesy 
                  of my Uncle Colin, my brothers Simon and Mark (and there party 
                  animal wives/girls), and the queen of alkahol Tasmin. (ZC of 
                  course did not encourage drinking but still managed to fill 
                  out glasses with Colin's home made potent drinks almost hourly.)</p>
                <p>I am now working in Blauvelt NY (just outside the NJ border). 
                  Work is only 25 mins NE, but 1hr in the snow. </p>
                <p>I have finally added 9 pages of Cruise pictures taken on our 
                  7 day Caribbean cruise that we took last year. I have a pile 
                  more pics to add, but I think I will do the XMAS UK ones first. 
                  So check out the Cruise ones now, and maybe later today I will 
                  have the UK ones done..</p>

                    We have a nice 2 bedroom apartment (<a href="http://www.rent.net/ctg/cgi-bin/RentNet/CmplxDetails?property=highlandsatwestwood" target="_blank">'<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The

                    The cat loves it and I rekon that this place has the best

                    getting fixed. So I am stuck watching crappy pan and scan

       Stew!&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah party and beer!
       <p>Well we are now in New Jersey.&nbsp; Living in the Sheraton Hotel in
       Mahwah.&nbsp; Found the local climbing gym. Pictures will be posted as
       soon as I catch up on the old picces that need to be posted! Weather here
       is shitty. Clouds, rain and general NZ winter type.&nbsp; Spring is
       coming and I have seen a few new leaves.&nbsp; Seems to be heaps of
       climbing spots around here so I will tell you all about them once I track
       them down.</p>
       <p>I added a pile more pages. See Appleton 8 and Climbing 1 to 7!&nbsp; A
       few more Appleton ones and heaps of climbing ones.</p>
       <p>Ang is sick in bed at the moment. Just how I like her&nbsp; (in bed
       that is - not sick).&nbsp; When she is better she will become my full
       time belay slave again.&nbsp; :)</p>
       <p>The client I am at (Minolta) demand suits all day. YUK. So I went out
       and got some new suits. 5k later, I return home with 2 Giorgio Armani
       suits, some GA ties, and Donna Karan shirts. Look dam sharp but poorer
       now! (PS Don't anyone tell my mum that I spent that much)</p>
       <p>We have even bought our tickets home. Ang is returning 9/4 and me
       9/26.&nbsp; We will be home for a week. Just enough time for a few stag
       do's and a wedding.&nbsp; :)</p>
       <p>Countdown has changed. Now counts down to W Day.&nbsp;</p>
       <p>Oh yeah - a big hello to the newest Suter on the net. YAH! Good to see
       old Colin made it.&nbsp;</p>
       <p>If anyone does not know the pics password, or has forgotten - email
       me! <a href="mailto:nick@nickme.com">nick@nickme.com</a></p>

       <p>I am back in the states now.&nbsp; Still at J.J. Keller in
       Wisconsin.&nbsp; My last day there will be 26th of March.&nbsp; Angela is
       still in NZ.&nbsp; In fact she is at the American Embassy right now
       sorting out her VISA.&nbsp; In a few hours we will know if it has been
       approved.&nbsp; I sure darn hope it is!</p>
       <p>She will be flying over on Thursday.&nbsp; Leaving Thursday night, and
       arriving in Appleton Wisconsin Thursday nite.&nbsp; She must have a very
       fast broom...&nbsp; :)</p>
       <p>I have heaps of NZ climbing and holiday pics to put on the net.&nbsp;
       I will do it later this week so hang tight.&nbsp; If anyone is having
       problems (yes even my pommie relatives) just email me at <a href="mailto:nick@nickme.com">nick@nickme.com</a></p>
       <p>Take care all.</p>
